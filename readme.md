# Apple Health Analysis

Out iphones and Apple Watches collect a plethora of valuable peices of health data. This is an exciting oppurtunity to employ your data wrangling and vizualization skills.

## How to get the data
1. Open Health app on your iPhone
2. Click on profile photo on the top-right corner
3. Scroll down and tap on **Export All Health Data**

## Choose a variable that matters to you
You can investigate how and why your BodyMass changes over the time. In this project I found out I only had 5 data points for my weight which meant I could not really work with my weight. Instead I chose to look at my **HeartRate** and **RestingHeartRate** since these are direct measures of a person's fitness level. That is, the fitter a person is the lower the avg heart rate. It was exciting especially gievn the fact that I started my weight loss journy on Nov 2020.

## Results 
I found out that my avg heart rate dropped from 90+ bpm to 78 bpm. This is an eye opening hard proof of my fitness tranformation.
